**[Click Here to view our Source](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings/resource/389dab1c-1e2e-4b13-83bf-d05a0219fe3e)** <br />
**Data Variables:** Name, Name ID, Mass (g), Fall, Year, Lat, Lon, Geolocation, Reclass  <br />
**Resources Utilized:** CSV, JSON  <br />

## Objective

Use this data to answer these questions: <br />
- Where are meteorites falling and being found? <br />
- What are the most commonly found meteorite types? <br />
- Are the more modern century’s collecting more meteorites compared to older century’s? <br />

## SQL Evaluation 

We utilized SQL to transform our dataset in various ways. We were able to create new categorizations within the data using various case statements.  The new columns we created were: Century, Size Group, Hemisphere and Classification Group. Code for this can be seen in Meteorites.sql, and various corresponding data rollups can be found in the "SQL-Data-Outputs" Folder in our GitHub.

## If we had more time...

- We would add more variables to our map.  Mostly we wanted to add different colored markers for fell and found <br />
- We would create more visuals in plotly utilizing the categories created in SQL <br />
