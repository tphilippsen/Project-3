# *Project 3* - Data Analysis and Visualization of Meteorite History

## [Data Source](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings/resource/389dab1c-1e2e-4b13-83bf-d05a0219fe3e)

Data Variables: Name, Name ID, Mass (g), Fall, Year, Lat, Lon, Geolocation, Reclass  <br />

Resources Utilized: CSV, JSON  <br />

Max Year in Dataset: 2013  <br />

## Objective

We want to use this data to answer the below questions about meteors: 
- Where are meteorites falling and being found?
- What are the most commonly found meteorite types?
- Are the more modern century’s collecting more meteorites compared to older century’s?

## SQL Evaluation 

We utilized SQL to transform our dataset in various ways. The biggest benefit was by creating different categories within the data using the case when function.  The categories we created are: Century, Size Group, Hemisphere and Classification Group. Various data rollups for these categories can be found in the "SQL" Folder in our GitHub.

## If we had more time...

- We would add more variables to our map.  Mostly we wanted to add different colored markers for fell and found 
- We would create more visuals in plotly utilizing the categories created in SQL
