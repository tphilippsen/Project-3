**[Click Here to view our Source](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/meteorite-landings/resource/389dab1c-1e2e-4b13-83bf-d05a0219fe3e)** <br />
**Resources Utilized:** CSV, JSON  <br />
**Data Variables:** Name, Name ID, Mass (g), Fall, Year, Lat, Lon, Geolocation, Reclass  <br />

## Objective

Use this data to answer these questions: <br />
- Where are meteorites falling and being found? <br />
- What are the most commonly found types of meteorites? <br />
- Are there more meteorites being found now, compared to older-less populated centuryâ€™s? <br />

## SQL Evaluation 

We utilized SQL to transform our dataset in various ways. We were able to create new categorizations within the data using multiple case statements.  The new columns we created were: Century, Size Group, Hemisphere and Classification Group. The code for this transformation can be seen in Meteorites.sql, and various corresponding data rollups can be found in the "SQL-Data-Outputs" Folder on our GitHub.

## If we had more time...

- We would add more variables to our map.  Mostly we wanted to add different colored markers for fell and found <br />
- We would create more visuals in plotly utilizing the categories created in SQL <br />
